After 2 years of being done my home network is slowly coming back to life.  
Along with some of my sites. Starting in the next few week I will start incorporating  
those sites and posting to them.  
[http://hak.casjay.net](http://hak.casjay.net)will be  used as a learning site as I start playing with the wifipinapple.  
[http://security.casjay.net](http://security.casjay.net)will be used a place to start keeping notes and how I set things up.
