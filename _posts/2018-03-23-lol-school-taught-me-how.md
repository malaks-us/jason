High school taught me how to wake up at 7:00 and leave my house at 6:55  
  
School taught me how not to sleep cause I would work 3pm to 3am get home  
around 330am fall asleep around 4. Then get up and get ready for school so  
I could leave by 640 to be to school at 7 and do homework with a couple of friends...
